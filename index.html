      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Guy. I was born and raised in Northern California, but now I call Oregon home. I like to keep
        my life pretty simple, and focus all my energy on just a few things that I find rewarding. These include a few
        strong friendships, time outdoors, and work that is fulfilling.</p>
