      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Guy. I was born and raised in Northern California, but now I call Oregon home. I like to keep
        my life pretty simple, and focus all my energy on just a few things that I find rewarding. These include a few
        strong friendships, time outdoors, and work that is fulfilling.</p>

      <h2>Job Experience</h2>
      <p>My career started in print production, and from there I made my way into project management. I lived in
        Nashville, TN for a while, where I managed packaging design projects for Dollar General's private brands. When I
        came back out west, I jumped back into print production for a bit, then spent the past five years managing print
        procurement for Columbia Sportswear and Unilever. Most recently, I managed a team of project managers in support
        of Unilever's retail display production.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>My primary goal is to find a career path that is rewarding to me, offers constant learning opportunities, and
        leaves me energized. I would also like to buy a small house that is conveniently located to
        some rivers and trails, and has a back yard for my dog to run around in.</p>
