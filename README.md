## Lab 01 - 4.05.22

- For this lab, I've created an "About Me" page that includes a guessing game

- I borrowed a bit of code from myself, from Code 102 and also from code I had written in my off week (just as practice).

### Reflections & Comments

- This lab went pretty well, although I did get bogged down in the CSS a bit - just trying to make it look a little cleaner. I'd like to have some key CSS tricks in my back pocket for building simple web sites, since there are so many declarations that I'm still not familiar with. I'm really enjoying the JavaScript portion of these projects so far, and I'm looking forward to diving deeper!
- This assignment took me about 3 hours to complete, which is about what I expected. It's pretty straightforward, but there's some room for creativity in there.

## Lab 02 - 4.06.22

- For this lab, I added some additional questions and responses that required various loops and if...else statements

Credit to:

- **Audrey Patterson** for help with my nested for loop on question 7
- **Katharine Swilley** for providing the solution for conditional statements on question 6
- **Vinny Shipley** for providing the solution for jumping out of the outer loop on question 7 (`i = 6;`)

### Reflections & Comments

- I struggled a bit with getting my code to execute on the loops. I would like to better understand why the `if...else` statement would not seem to work on my nested loop on question 7
- I feel pretty good about how I planned out my solutions before writing any code. I was able to put the general structure together pretty easily, but the devil is in the details!
