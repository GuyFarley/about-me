## Lab 01 - 4.05.22

- For this lab, I've created an "About Me" page that includes a guessing game

### Links & Resources

- I borrowed a bit of code from myself, from Code 102 and also from code I had written in my off week (just as practice).

### Reflections & Comments

- This lab went pretty well, although I did get bogged down in the CSS a bit - just trying to make it look a little cleaner. I'd like to have some key CSS tricks in my back pocket for building simple web sites, since there are so many declarations that I'm still not familiar with. I'm really enjoying the JavaScript portion of these projects so far, and I'm looking forward to diving deeper!
- This assignment took me about 3 hours to complete, which is about what I expected. It's pretty straightforward, but there's some room for creativity in there.
